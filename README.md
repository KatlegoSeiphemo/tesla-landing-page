🚗💨 ASSIGNMENT: Tesla Landing Page (Deployed on Netlify)


🎯 Objective

Your mission: 
clone the Tesla homepage (well… kinda 😅).This will test your HTML + CSS skills and help you understand the magic behind building a landing page.
Nothing too fancy — lots of copy-pasting with a sprinkle of understanding ✨.

🏆 Outcomes

By the end of this assignment, you’ll be able to: 
✅ Write basic HTML + CSS code 
✅Understand HTML syntax (divs, headings, links, paragraphs, navbars, stylesheets) 
✅ Work with CSS (fonts, colors, hero banners, flexbox nav, hover effects, buttons, sticky footer bar)
 ✅Build something without AI
 ✅ Brag: “I deployed my first site on Netlify 🚀”

📋 Requirements

👩‍🎨 Design [20 Marks]

    Build a Tesla-inspired landing page with:
    Hero section (car image + headline + buttons) [10 Marks]
    Models section (Model S, 3, X, Y) [5 Marks]
    Footer with nav links [ 5 Marks]

Bonus ⭐: Make it responsive with media queries (not covered in class yet, but show me you’re curious 😎).

🌍 Deployment - No Deployment = no submission.

    Deploy your page on Netlify (drag-and-drop = done ✅).
    Make sure the link is public + working.
    Protip ⚠️: Don’t put “Tesla” in your URL or use their logo — Netlify might
    think you’re phishing. We’re not here for CyberSec drama 😅.


📤 Submission

Hand in the following: 

🔗 Netlify live link (e.g. https://yourname-ecars.netlify.app) 
💻 GitHub Repo link (just upload your code — no need for git commits/pushes yet, that’s coming later 👀).

⚡️ Remember: This isn’t about perfection, it’s about practice. Build it, break it, fix it, and have fun!
